	Generic Industrial IO Buffer Monitor

generic_buffer is a program to read samples from an Industrial IO sensor and
print them.

To run, just
	sudo ./generic_buffer -c count -n name
where count is how many samples to print and name is the IIO name of the sensor.

To check whether the Yoga sensor is working on your system, try
	sudo ./generic_buffer -c 10 -n gyro_3d
If you get output like the following (maybe after rotating the Yoga) then
things should be set up correctly (but it is still possible that the
accelerometer is stuck somehow).

If you get only the first four lines of the above, then the sensor or sensor
hub is stuck somehow.  You could try again with accel_3d to see if the
accelerometer is working.  (This wasn't recommended as the first try, as it
is possible to get a sensor stuck.)  A sensor can be stuck because its
channels cannot be enabled, because its buffer cannot be set up, because its
trigger cannot be set up, and probably for other reasons.

If you get no output, an error message, or "Failed to find the gyro_3d" then 
something is wrong with your setup.  It could be that Industrial IO is not
in your distribution.  It could be that you don't have the right sort of
chip.  It could be that something went wrong when the devices were
initialized.  You will have to dig around to see what is wrong.
